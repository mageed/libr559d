## 1.	Course Rationale & Goal: 

**Rationale/Background:**  

As social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube continue to play an important role in mediated communication today, be it at organizational or individual levels, the volume of data generated by their users increase phenomenally. Accordingly, searches and processing of social Web data beyond the limiting level of surface words are becoming increasingly important to business and governmental bodies, as well as to lay Web users. Detection of sentiment, emotion, deception, gender, sarcasm, age, perspective, topic, community, and personality are all valuable social meaning components that promise to be important elements of next generation search engines. The emerging area of extracting social meaning from social network data using automated methods is known as Social Media Intelligence (SMI).  

**Goal:**  

This course provides a graduate-level introduction to Social Media Intelligence (SMI) and its associated methods. The goal of the course is to create an interactive learning community around the theme of SMI. This includes familiarizing students with the types and use of social media, and providing hands-on experience in managing, analyzing, and mining social data using available tools (e.g., dashboards) and automated methods (e.g., natural language processing and machine learning technologies). We will read, discuss, and critique claims and findings from contemporary research related to SMI. We will also address practical issues related to successfully managing social media platforms, launching marketing campaigns, and using and building tools to analyze and mine social media. 

**Potential audiences for this course include, but are not limited to:** 

- People interested in text analytics, information retrieval, information visualization, human-information interaction, natural language processing, machine learning, etc., who want to prepare for, or significantly advance, carrying out research in these fields.
- People interested in practical experience on effective usage, management, analytics, and mining of social media in work places (e.g., libraries, museums, companies).

## 2.	Course Objectives:  

**Upon completion of this course students will be able to:** 

- Understand a wide range of social media usage, management, and mining concepts and tasks and their relevance to the information needs of diverse individuals, communities and organizations. [1.1]
- Enhance interpersonal and written communication skills. [2.1]
- Collaborate effectively with peers through course assignments. [3.1]

**Assignments in Detail**

**Assignment 1:** Class presentation
Each student is expected to present once during the course of the semester. For this assignment, each student will choose one or more papers and/or book chapters in consultation with the instructor. The student will then be responsible for preparing slides (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint or pdf format) for the content and presenting to class in one of the class sessions. The following criteria are required for the presentation:
- Students are expected to submit their slides to the instructor by 5:00 pm the day before the presentation is due. The instructor will then make the slides available to the whole class.
- Students are encouraged to rehearse two-to-three times before presenting in class, make use of body language, use illustrative examples and visualizations, and deliver their presentation in the assigned time.

**Grading:** Grading for this assignment will be based on content, presentation skills, clarity of presentation, and ability to answer questions. 

**Deliverables:** Presentation slides and actual presentation 
Students are expected to submit their slides to instructor and deliver the presentation in class to satisfy this requirement.

**Assignment 2:** Personal readings journal
Students are required to keep a personal readings journal where you summarize and reflect on the weekly readings. The journal should be a single Word document that you update with the new content every week. Each week’s log can be in the range of 300-400 words summarizing the main ideas of the readings. Many of the papers we read apply different marketing, management, and/or mining methods and for each of these you are expected summarize the main points the author makes. For example, for an intelligence task, you are expected to identify the social concept (e.g., emotion), the way it is operationalized, the basic idea of a method used, the datasets exploited, and the results acquired. In addition, you are expected to engage critically by possibly identifying limitations and extensions you can think of. The personal readings journal is meant to keep you involved throughout the course of the term. You are also expected to participate in discussions in class, based on your readings and the journal should help with this regard. You are expected to have a total of 10 logs in the journal, corresponding to the readings of the first 10 weeks. Each week’s log is only accepted if you attend class. If you miss a class, this automatically means you are not allowed to update/submit a log for the session/sessions you missed. As such, failure to attend class without a necessary excuse (e.g., a sickness or another emergency) will result in a lower class grade. 

**Deliverables:** A personal readings journal
A total of 10 logs in a single Word document.

**Assignment 3:** Analysis and evaluation of a professional social media source
For this assignment, students are expected to use a [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kpvcvTxIiFuzhiWkDD03oUCydCsnLKe5NDasrg_d0iI/edit) that will be provided by the instructor as a basis for conducting a content analysis of a social media source of their choice. The source can be one or more of the social media accounts of a library, museum, company, school, or any other organization. The [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kpvcvTxIiFuzhiWkDD03oUCydCsnLKe5NDasrg_d0iI/edit) will guide you for analyzing the social media outlet of the organization (e.g., the Twitter account of the Vancouver Public Library https://twitter.com/VPL) in terms of, for example, frequency and time of postings, media used, interaction with users, topics of posts, network (e.g., which users are followed). Based on your analysis, you are expected to provide a critical evaluation of the extent to which an organization is successful in employing social media to reach its goal, including compared to similar organizations. As a result of your evaluation, you should include a section of recommendations to improve the performance of the organization on the social media platform you analyzed.

**Deliverables:** A critical analysis and evaluation of a professional social media outlet (~ 2000 words)
For this assignment, students are required to provide a written report with their analysis and evaluation. The evaluation should be supported by quantitative evidence as well as a qualitative appraisal of the performance of the source. You should include a brief introduction, follow by the analysis and evaluation (you have the freedom to thematically organize the analysis and evaluation into different subsection), a section on recommendations as described above, and a conclusion. You are expected to follow norms of academic writing and document and support your claims by academic and professional references. You are also encouraged to make use of Tables, figures, screenshots, and visualizations.

**Assignment 4:** A practical intelligence task
This is an exercise involving application of the methods you are trained on in class. For this assignment, you will be given a data set and a practical task to execute. For example, you may be provided a dataset labeled with sentiment tags to build a simple, rule-based system to detect the sentiment. You will be trained in class on similar tasks. Python example code related to similar tasks will be shared by the instructor and discussed with class. Once you are done with this assignment, you are expected to submit the code you wrote as well as a short written description (in a pdf document) of your approach to solving the problem.

**The following criteria is required for this assignment:**

- You must run your code before submitting, and ensure it is working. Also, you should provide a sample in your write up from the output itself (e.g., the first 5-10 lines from a file or a list of words that you extract). For code that writes to a file, at the discretion of the instructor, you may be asked to deliver the output files as well.
- For each problem, in addition to your code, you should provide explanatory Python comments as appropriate. Your comments should be short and to-the-point. As a programmer, you should develop a sense as to when to use comments and when not. This requirement is meant to teach you about using comments. Using comments will be discussed in class and feedback on your deliverables will be provided. 

**Deliverables:** Written description + iPython notebooks with code
- For each of assignments 3 and assignment 4, you are required to submit a written description (~ 2000 words) and an iPython notebook including your code and relevant narratives/comments, etc.

**Assignment 5:** Term Project
The purposes of this assignment include:
- Identifying, analyzing, assessing, and solving a problem via use of social media data;
- Applying social media intelligence methods to a practical task of your choice, after consultation with the instructor;
- Developing oral and written communication skills through discussions with classmates and instructor;
- Demonstrating ability to work as part of a team, including initiative taking, integrity, dependability and co-operation, and effective collaboration.

For this assignment, each student is required to work as part of a group of of 2/3\* on a project involving a practical task and usually a significant amount of coding. Example projects include harvesting Twitter data toward a specific topic and building a system of analysis that identifies people’s views (pros and cons) around the topic (e.g., Syrian refugees, gun control, satisfaction with government performance on a given sector). This can be done via use of sentiment analysis, for example. Students can also choose problems for which a gender comparison is expected to yield interesting insights (e.g., gender differences as to affect, activities, topical interests, language styles, personality). 

* A group of a different size may be possible after consultation with the instructor.

**Deliverables** 
**Proposal (500-700 words)**
- Who are the the group members?
- What are you mining?
- What motivates your work? Why is it important or useful to undertake the chosen task?
- How does your project compare to other projects people have conducted in the past?
- What are the different steps you will take to ensure success of the project? What are the smaller segments of which the bigger intelligence task is composed? And how will you conduct each small task?
- How does the work bread down and what each member of the team be contributing?
- Timeline for completing the project, including goals for each segment.

**Final Report/Paper (4000-6000 words)** 
The final deliverable should include:
- A detailed and clear description of your project, including the necessary sections, as appropriate. For example, you will need to include an abstract, introduction, research questions, a literature review, a description of datasets, implementation details and methods employed, results, and a conclusion involving limitations and future directions;
- All relevant code;
- All data used, whenever possible;
- Pointers to a live version of the project, if any;
- As appropriate, you should situate your work within the wider context of previous works and approaches, with supporting arguments (~ 15 sources);
- Employment of figures, tables, and visualizations as appropriate to enhance argument and facilitate communicating your findings/results;


## 9. Course Policies

**Attendance:** The UBC calendar states: “Regular attendance is expected of students in all their classes (including lectures, laboratories, tutorials, seminars, etc.). Students who neglect their academic work and assignments may be excluded from the final examinations. Students who are unavoidably absent because of illness or disability should report to their instructors on return to classes.”

**Evaluation:** All assignments will be marked using the evaluative criteria given in this syllabus and also those provided on the SLAIS web site. 

**Written & Spoken English Requirement:** Written and spoken work may receive a lower mark if it is, in the opinion of the instructor, deficient in English. 

**Access & Diversity:** Access & Diversity works with the University to create an inclusive living and learning environment in which all students can thrive. The University accommodates students with disabilities who have registered with the Access and Diversity unit: [http://www.students.ubc.ca/access/drc.cfm]. You must register with the Disability Resource Centre to be granted special accommodations for any on-going conditions. 
** Religious Accommodation:** The University accommodates students whose religious obligations conflict with attendance, submitting assignments, or completing scheduled tests and examinations. Please let your instructor know in advance, preferably in the first week of class, if you will require any accommodation on these grounds. Students who plan to be absent for varsity athletics, family obligations, or other similar commitments, cannot assume they will be accommodated, and should discuss their commitments with the instructor before the course drop date. UBC policy on Religious Holidays: http://www.universitycounsel.ubc.ca/policies/policy65.pdf.

## Academic Integrity
** Plagiarism** 
The Faculty of Arts considers plagiarism to be the most serious academic offence that a student can commit. Regardless of whether or not it was committed intentionally, plagiarism has serious academic consequences and can result in expulsion from the university. Plagiarism involves the improper use of somebody else's words or ideas in one's work. 

It is your responsibility to make sure you fully understand what plagiarism is. Many students who think they understand plagiarism do in fact commit what UBC calls "reckless plagiarism." Below is an excerpt on reckless plagiarism from UBC Faculty of Arts' leaflet, "Plagiarism Avoided: Taking Responsibility for Your Work," (http://www.arts.ubc.ca/arts-students/plagiarism-avoided.html).

"The bulk of plagiarism falls into this category. Reckless plagiarism is often the result of careless research, poor time management, and a lack of confidence in your own ability to think critically. Examples of reckless plagiarism include:

- Taking phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or statistical findings from a variety of sources and piecing them together into an essay (piecemeal plagiarism);
- Taking the words of another author and failing to note clearly that they are not your own. In other words, you have not put a direct quotation within quotation marks;
- Using statistical findings without acknowledging your source;
- Taking another author's idea, without your own critical analysis, and failing to acknowledge that this idea is not yours;
- Paraphrasing (i.e. rewording or rearranging words so that your work resembles, but does not copy, the original) without acknowledging your source;
- Using footnotes or material quoted in other sources as if they were the results of your own research; and
- Submitting a piece of work with inaccurate text references, sloppy footnotes, or incomplete source (bibliographic) information."

Bear in mind that this is only one example of the different forms of plagiarism. Before preparing for their written assignments, students are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with the following source on plagiarism: the Academic Integrity Resource Centre http://help.library.ubc.ca/researching/academic-integrity. Additional information is available on the Connect site http://connect.ubc.ca. 

If after reading these materials you still are unsure about how to properly use sources in your work, please ask me for clarification. Students are held responsible for knowing and following all University regulations regarding academic dishonesty. If a student does not know how to properly cite a source or what constitutes proper use of a source it is the student's personal responsibility to obtain the needed information and to apply it within University guidelines and policies. If evidence of academic dishonesty is found in a course assignment, previously submitted work in this course may be reviewed for possible academic dishonesty and grades modified as appropriate. UBC policy requires that all suspected cases of academic dishonesty must be forwarded to the Dean for possible action.
